		<name>Watchglass</name>
		<desc>Watchglasses are round glass panes with a diameter of around 5 - 10 cm which are used in the various experimental techniques. The border is bent upwards to allow the watchglass to hold small amounts of liquids in order to let them evaporate. The evaporation can be accelerated by heating the watchglass with a Bunsen burner. Watchglasses can also be used to cover petri dishes or beakers. Moreover watchglasses are suited to weighing small amounts of matter or alternatively drying them in the airing cupboard. The term watchglass is derived from the former pocket watches' protection glass which was often domed.</desc>

		<name>Dehydrator</name>
		<desc>A dehydrator is a laboratory apparatus which is often made of glass and serves to dry chemical matters, that is, to remove water or liquid from a sample.
			In principle it is a glass bowl with cap which has a planar grinding so that the bowl is air tight closeable. The dehydrator's lower part is ordinarily filled with a drying agent e.g. calcium chloride, silica gel, phosphoric anhydride or sulphuric acid. The sample to be dried is placed on a diaphanous cartridge of plastic or ceramics above the drying agent.
			The drying agent is hygroscopic, which means that it dehumidifies its environment by absorbing water vapor. The dry atmosphere then takes up water from the sample to be dried.</desc>

		<name>Water Jet Pump</name>
		<desc>The water jet pump has two entry pipes and one exit and consists in principle of two pipes one inside the other. At the water entry a water jet shoots under full pressure out of a nozzle into a slightly larger pipe. Thereby the water jet carries away air or fluid from the second entry. &lt;br&gt; this is caused by the negative pressure in a drifting fluid. Thus it is an application of the hydrodynamic paradox. This says that objects close to drifting fluids are aspirated instead of being pushed away.</desc>

		<desc>Heating coils are used to heat flasks and other containers. Multiple heating coils can be connected with a thermometer so that the heat will not exceed a specified temperature. It is possible to use a magnetic field inside the heating coil to stir fluids with a magnetic stirrer. This will homogenize the fluid in terms of temperature and composition.</desc>

		<name>Vortexer</name>
		<desc>A vortexer serves to homogenize reagents found in laboratories. The container containing liquid to be homogenized is put on a platform. The platform shakes by rotary agitation up to 3000RPM at which point a contact sensor is activated. In this way extremely small volumes of fluid can be homogenized quickly as well. It is the opposite of a centrifuge, used to separate fluids.</desc>

		<name>Rotary Evaporator</name>
		<desc>A rotary evaporator consists of a round flask in a bath of hot water that is designed to evaporate solvents. The flask is rotated and the solvent collects under a vacuum onto a condenser and drips into a condensate collecting flask. in this way solutions can be concentrated or purified. By attaching a vacuum pump, the air pressure and therefore  the boiling point of the fluid can be decreased.</desc>

		<name>Pipette</name>
		<desc>Pipettes are used to introduce small quantities of liquids in laboratories. A pipette has a volume scale and as a rule pileusballs are used as droppers for liquids. Both sorts of pipettes are calibrated for fluids with a temperature of 20Â°C and for time of outflow (signified by "Ex."). If needed times of outflow are indicated on the pipettes.</desc>

		<name>Erlenmeyer Flask</name>
		<desc>This flask named after the chemist Emil Erlenmeyer (1825-1909) comes - unlike the beaker - with an inverted conical base and a cylindrical neck. There are different types of Erlenmeyer flasks for laboratory applications, the narrow and wide neck form. Depending on the application the flask may have precision grinding to allow good connection to other containers.
			&lt;br&gt;
			The narrow neck reduces the risk of fluid escaping, especially when boiling or during reactions which agitate the contents.
			&lt;br&gt;
			An Erlenmeyer flask is useful for mixing fluids or accelerating reactions by stirring or shaking, for example. The Erlenmeyer flask is particularly suited for a magnetic stirrer, since it can be placed directly on the stirring platform. A round-bottomed flask, by contrast, must be placed on a cork ring on the stirring platform.

		<name>Distillation bridge</name>
		<desc>To separate a mixture you can use distillation amongst others. The distillation bridge is thereby the way between the two pots. In the one pot there is the mixture to be separated. Through heating, a gas forms which is lead through the bridge. At the end of the bridge the gas phase is condensed again and drips in a round flask. As a rule, the bridge is cooled by return flow. In addition, there is often a thermometer for controlling the temperature on the distillation bridge.</desc>

		<name>Contact Thermometer</name>
		<desc>A contact thermometer is different from a regular thermometer because of its sensor for the current temperature. Such a thermometer is connected with a heating coild. If the sensor notices that the aimed temperature has been reached the contact thermometer will make the heating coild stop heating. Therefore in an experiment it is possible to have a constant temperature.</desc>
