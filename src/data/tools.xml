		<name>Watchglas</name>
		<desc>Watchglasses are round glass panes with a diameter of circa 5 - 10 cm which are used in the laboratory technics. Their border is a bit bent up so that you can fill them with little amounts of liquids in order to let them evaporate. The evaporation can be accelerated by heating the watchglass with a Bunsen burner. Watchglassen also can be used to cover petri dishes or beakers. Moreover watchglasses are suited to weigh little amounts of matter or alternatively dry them in the airing cupboard. The term watchglass is derived from the former pocket watches' protection glass which was often domed.</desc>

		<name>Dehydrator</name>
		<desc>A dehydrator is a laboratory apparatus which is often made of glass and serves to dry chemical matters, means for deprivation of water alternatively liquid.
			In principle it is a glass bowl with cap which has a planar grinding so that the bowl is air tight closeable. The dehydrator's lower part is ordinarily filled with a drying agent e.g. calcium chloride, silica gel, phosphoric anhydride or sulphuric acid. On a diaphanous cartridge of plastic or ceramics above the drying agent the matter is put in order to dry.
			The drying agent is hygroscopic that means it dehumidifies its environment and absorbs the humidity. The atmosphere in the dehydrator dryed by the drying agent dehumidifies water alternatively dissolver tself from the matter to dry.</desc>

		<name>Water Jet Pump</name>
		<desc>The water jet pump has two entries and one exit and consists in principle of two pipes that are sticked into each other. At the water entry a water jet shoots under full fuel-line pressure out of a nozzle into a bit larger pipe. Thereby the water jet carries away air or fluid from the second entry. &lt;br&gt; this is caused by the negativ pressure in a drifting fluid. Thus it is an appliance of the hydrodynamic paradox. This says that objects close to drifting fluids are aspirated instead of being pushed away.</desc>

		<name>Heating Coil</name>
		<desc>Heating coils are used to heat flasks and other containers. Multiple heating coils can be connected with a thermometer so that the heat will not exceed a specified temperature. It is possible to use a magnetic field inside the heating coil to stir fluids with a magnetic stirrer. This will homogenize the fluid in terms of temperature and composition.</desc>

		<name>Vortexer</name>
		<desc>A vortexer serves to homogenize reagents found in laboratories. The container containing liquid to be homogenized is put on a platform. The platform shakes by rotary agitation up to 3000RPM when a contact sensor is activated. This way extremely small volumes of fluid can be homogenized quickly as well. It is the opposite of a centrifuge, used to separate fluids.</desc>

		<name>Rotary Evaporator</name>
		<desc>A rotary evaporator consists of a round flask in a bath of hot water that is designed to evaporate solvents. The flask is rotated and the solvent collects under a vacuum onto a condenser and drips into a condensate collecting flask. This way solutions can be concentrated or purified. Through an attached vacuum pump the boiling point of the fluid can be decreased.</desc>

		<name>Pipette</name>
		<desc>Pipettes serve to dose liquids in laboratories. On a pipette there is a volume scale. As a rule pileusballs are used as pipettors. Both sorts of pipettes are adjusted to fluids with a temperature of 20Â°C and to outflow (Ex.). If needed times of outflow are indicated on the pipettes.</desc>

		<name>Erlenmeyer Flask</name>
		<desc>This flask named after the chemist Emil Erlenmeyer (1825-1909) comes - unlike the beaker - with an inverted conical base with a cylindrical neck. There are different types of erlenmeyer flasks in the laboratory application, the narrow and wide neck form and depending on the application also flasks with a normed grinding.
			&lt;br&gt;
			Through the narrowing neck the danger that fluids escape uncontrolled of the flask while addition of matter, brandishing, stiring or boiling is explicit smaller than by a beaker.
			&lt;br&gt;
			So you can in an Erlenmeyer flask easily e.g. mix fluids or accelerate solution processes by - also relatively keenly - stiring or brandishing. He also is suited - like the round-bottomed flask - for the magnetic stirrer but can be put directly because of his flat bottom. (The round-bottomed flask whereas needs a cork ring or a stage for a safe stand, the latter makes brandishing with the hand or checking by holding into back light impossible.)</desc>

		<name>Ultrasonic Bath</name>

		<name>Distillation bridge</name>
		<desc>To separate a mixture you can use distillation amongst others. The distillation bridge is thereby the way between the two pots. In the one pot there is the mixture to be separated. Through heating, a gas forms which is lead through the bridge. At the end of the bridge the gas phase is condensed again and drips in a round flask. As a rule, the bridge is cooled by return flow. In addition, there is often a thermometer for controlling the temperature on the distillation bridge.</desc>

		<desc>At the four ends of this separation beaker you put four small caps. While distilling, you can turn the beaker by 60 degree after a certain temperate has been reached. This way, at the end of the distillation all four caps have a specific liquid in it, depending on the boiling points of the liquid distilled.</desc>

		<name>Contact Thermometer</name>
		<desc>A contact thermometer is different from a regular thermometer because of its sensor for the current temperature. Such a thermometer is connected with a heating coild. If the sensor notices that the aimed temperature has been reached the contact thermometer will make the heating coild stop heating. Therefore in an experiment it is possible to have a constant temperature.</desc>
