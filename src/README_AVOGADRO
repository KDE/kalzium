For the Kalzium of KDE 4.0 and 4.1 we decided to add a local copy of libavogadro.
The reason is that libavogadro is to much in flux to be used as a real library.
The internal copy will be synced with the official library as often
as possible without adding new features after the freeze.

For KDE 4.2 we will remove the internal copy and depend on
the real libavogadro as a dependency.

libavogadro is a lib for rendering and also
editing (drawing) molecules with Qt, OpenGL and OpenBabel.
