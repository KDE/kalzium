			 TODO for Kalzium KDE4
			 =====================

* When no atom model is available (orbitswidget.cpp, elements higher than Rg)
  disable the whole widget

* When no spectrum is available disable the whole widget

* 3D-code: Please read the TODO on the Avogadro side. All ideas and
  any progress is handled there: https://avogadro.cc/devel/to_do_for_11/

* Multiplechoicetests with autogenerated questions:
	* "What element does the symbol Br represent?"
	* "What is the symbol for gold?"
	* "Which element (show two or more) has a greater mass?"
  These questions can be autogenerated because the answers are
  already in the database

* Plotting
  + Add groups of elements, for example "Metals", 4th Period
    transition metals and so on. The user can easily select them
    and only plot the selected group
  + More than one group should be plottable at once.
    This would enable the user to compare two or more groups,
    e. g. 4th with 5th group

* Add more than only one mode to Kalzium, e. g. a mode with simplified
  user interface (less looks, easier menu structure, less information
  in the infodialog) and a full-mode where everything is enabled.

* There should be more data about the elements, for example which
  chemistry-nobel-prize was won in that year (+/- 5 years or so)

* Make use of hotnewstuff. In the detailinfodlg there should be
  a weblookup. If the user click on a button Konq will start with
  a page about the element. Of course, the user should be able
  to decide which page.
  For this we could create a simple editor and store it in xml.
  on edu.kde.org we would enable KHNS so that users can share
  their pages. Imagine for example the different wikipedia-languages

* Add the weblookup also in the glossary

* Besides although for the "common user" is more easy to understand
  the information in "... years", it's more correct and flexible in
  scientific terms to use the scientific notation: ...x10e9 years.

* Add lesson-mode? The idea is that a teacher could create xml-files
  which can somehow be used as lessons. Perhaps something like
  "find out how many element boiled at 200 Degree Celsius and above.
  With that information: Why is it so?"

* Add experimental mode: A teacher defines experiments (in xml) where
  photos and texts are used to represent a experiment/task. Perhaps
  combined with openoffice-files (charts and so on). Like in CheExp.

* Thinking on people with some disabilities, it would be great if they can
  select the elements on the grid by using cursor keys (or just tab key).

* There's no view of the natural occurrence of the elements. Look at
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table_(standard) and see the notes
  about borders.

* There are no oxidation information for the elements.
  Check with the blue obelisk project.

* Printing: print properties selected by the user

* Spectrum-Classes
  + Create an editor. The user enters some wavelength and Kalzium will
    create a graphic from that data.

* Some websites with a lot of information:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_chemistry
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_chemical_element_discovery
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_chemistry
http://chemipedia.org/mediawiki/index.php/Hauptseite
http://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/Handbook/periodictable.htm


--- DONE ---

* Create a generic slider class. This slider-widget will be able to hide or
  show elements based on a value. For example (like today) the SOM, but also
  the atomic weight, the density or the electron-affinity.
  This would help the user to get "a feeling" for the properties of the elements
  and would complement the gradient feature very well.

* Making the table scalable. The basic code is already there and working. See
 - http://github.com/cryos/avogadro/blob/master/libavogadro/src/periodictableview.cpp
 - http://github.com/cryos/avogadro/blob/master/libavogadro/src/periodictableview.h
 That code needs to be finished (making it scalable) and then ported to Kalzium
