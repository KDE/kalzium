			 TODO for Kalzium 1.5
			 ===================

Bugs
----

* Miscellaneous bugs:
  + Make use of the biological symbol.	     				----
    CN: I lost the "translation" though, will have to look after it.
	CN: I have deactivated the drawingconde
  + correct mass-rounding
    presumably, the arg()-funktion now rounds wrong			-----


================================================================
                       Future versions

* Export to html and csv comes into my mind. Pretty easy I
  guess. Something like that was in Kalzium of KDE 3.1 I
  think.  But my implementation sucked so much I removed it.

* Calculator: On "Remove": 'Grey out' the elements which are not
  in the molecule so that it is easier to spot the elements which
  can be removed.

* Add KHotNewStuff support (xml) so that a user can define which
  dates are displayed in the timeline (see SOM)
  
* Log-scale of the gradient						

* Make the glossary also into a dictionary
  CN: I don't understand this point...

* Plotting
  + Add groups of elements, for example "Metals", 4th Period		
    transitionmetals and so on. The user can easily select them 
    and only plot the selected group
  + More than one group should be plottable at once.			
    This would enable the user to compare two or more groups, 
    eg. 4th with 5th group

* Add more than only one mode to Kalzium, eg a mode with simplified
  user interface (less looks, easier menu structure, less information
  in the infodialog) and a full-mode where everything is enabled.

* There should be more data about the elements, for example which
  chemitry-nobel-prize was won in that year (+/- 5 years or so)

* Make use of hotnewstuff. In the detailinfodlg there should be
  a weblookup. If the user click on a button Konq will start with
  a page about the element. Of course, the user should be able
  to decide which page.
  For this we could create a simple editor and store it in xml.
  on edu.kde.org we would enable KHNS so that users can share
  their pages. Imaginge for example the different wikipedia-languages

* Add the weblookup also in the glossary

* Besides although for the "common user" is more easy to understand 
  the information in "... years", it's more correct and flexible in 
  scientific terms to use the scientific notation: ...x10e9 years.

* Add lesson-mode? The idea is that a teacher could create xml-files
  which can somehow be used as lessons. Perhaps something like
  "find out how many element boild at 200 Degree Celsius and above.
  With that information: Why is it so?"

* Add experiental mode: A teacher defines experiments (in xml) where
  fotos and texts are used to represent a experiment/task. Perhaps
  combined with openoffice-files (charts and so on). Like in CheExp.

* Add two comboboxes to the infodialog: That way the user can search
  for an element by name and number. Like in CheExp

* Thinking on people with some disabilities, it would be great if they can 
select the elements on the grid by using cursor keys (or just tab key).

* Perhaps there must be a KComboBox in the toolbar where you can select the 
different views of the PTE.

* There's no view of the natural occurrence of the elements. Look at 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table_(standard) and see the notes 
about borders.

* Spectrum-Classes
  + Create an editor. The user enters some wavelength and Kalzium will
    create a graphic from that data.

* Some websites with a lot of information:
